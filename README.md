# BrainAgeGapsHCP

This is a repository for a graph-theoretic measure and multimodal data-based brain age prediction model. This repo includes code used to extract/calculate resting-state functional MRI graph measures (and others / TBA). Moreover, repo will include code used to implement the predictive algorithm.

This project is in progress.
